‚≠ê Rating App (CLI-Based)
üìå Description
This is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Python project that allows users to rate an app between 1 and 5 stars.

- If the rating is 1 to 3, the app asks for feedback to help improve the experience.
- If the rating is 4 or 5, it thanks the user and acknowledges the positive feedback.

- It's a great beginner-level project to practice:
- Conditional logic (if-elif-else)
- User input/output
- Basic program structure

üöÄ Features
- Accepts user rating from 1 to 5
- Detects and handles invalid input
- Collects feedback for low ratings
- Positive message for high ratings

#Example Output
- How much will you rate the app between 1-5?: 2
- Thank you for your rating
- What do we need to improve?
- Enter your feedback: More speed and better UI
- Thanks for the feedback! We will work on it.
